# Dark Mode & Profile Settings Implementation

## Overview
Comprehensive dark mode support has been implemented across the entire Qualis Digital platform, with a centralized Profile page for users to control their preferences and view account information.

## What's Been Implemented

### ✅ Profile Page
**Route**: `/profile`

Features:
- Account information display (name, email, role)
- Theme selector (Light/Dark mode toggle)
- Visual theme cards with icons
- Clean, user-friendly interface
- Accessible from all user dashboards

### ✅ Company Settings (Business Owners Only)
**Route**: `/settings/company`

Features:
- Company branding (logo, name, description)
- Separate from user profile settings
- Restricted to business_owner role only

### ✅ Dashboard Navigation Updates

All three dashboards now have a **Profile** button:

1. **Carer Dashboard**
   - Profile button in Quick Actions (first position)
   - Dark mode classes added to headers

2. **Manager Dashboard**
   - Profile button in Management Actions (first position)
   - Dark mode classes added to headers

3. **Business Owner Dashboard**
   - Profile button (primary action)
   - Company Settings button (secondary - branding only)
   - Dark mode classes added to headers

### ✅ Dark Mode Support

**Already Implemented:**
- ThemeProvider context with localStorage persistence
- ThemeToggle component (Sun/Moon icons)
- Dark mode classes in:
  - Auth pages (login/signup)
  - Profile page
  - Company settings page
  - Terms and Privacy pages
  - Dashboard headers
  - All Card components (via shadcn/ui)

**Pages with Dark Mode:**
- `/auth` - Login/Signup page
- `/profile` - User profile and preferences
- `/settings/company` - Company branding (business owners only)
- `/terms` - Terms of Service
- `/privacy` - Privacy Policy
- `/dashboard` - All dashboard variants
- Root layout background

## How It Works

### Theme Persistence
- User's theme choice saved to localStorage (`qualis-theme`)
- Persists across sessions
- Applies on page load before hydration

### Theme Options
- **Light Mode**: Clean, bright interface
- **Dark Mode**: Easy on the eyes, modern dark theme

### Access Points

Users can change theme from:
1. **Profile Page** (`/profile`) - Visual theme selector + account info
2. **Auth Page Header** - Theme toggle button (mobile & desktop)
3. **Company Settings** - Theme toggle in header (business owners)

### Navigation Structure

```
Dashboard
├── Profile (all users) - Personal settings & theme
└── Company Settings (business owners only) - Branding & logo
```

## Usage

### For End Users
1. Click "Profile" from any dashboard
2. View your account information
3. Select Light or Dark theme
4. Changes apply immediately and persist

### For Business Owners
1. Click "Profile" for personal settings (theme, account info)
2. Click "Company Settings" for branding (logo, company name)
3. Clear separation of concerns

### For Developers
All new pages should include dark mode classes:
- Text: `text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100`
- Backgrounds: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-950`
- Cards: `dark:bg-gray-900 dark:border-gray-800`
- Muted text: `text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400`

## Benefits of This Structure

✅ **Cleaner Navigation** - No generic "Settings" cluttering the menu
✅ **Clear Purpose** - Profile = personal, Company Settings = branding
✅ **Better UX** - Users see their info alongside preferences
✅ **Role-Based** - Business owners have both options, others just Profile
✅ **Intuitive Icons** - User icon for Profile, Settings icon for Company
