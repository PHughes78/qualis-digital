## ⚠️ Important: Database Migration Required

Before the new features work on production, you need to run the database migrations:

### Option 1: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: **qualis-digital**
3. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy and paste the contents of:
   - `supabase/migrations/007_company_settings.sql`
   - `supabase/migrations/008_manager_care_home_assignments.sql`
6. Click **Run** for each migration

### Option 2: Using Supabase CLI

```bash
# Link to production project
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Push migrations
supabase db push
```

### What the Migrations Do:

**Migration 007 (Company Settings):**
- Creates `company_settings` table
- Adds company branding (logo, colors, name)
- Sets up RLS policies

**Migration 008 (Manager Care Homes):**
- Creates `manager_care_homes` junction table
- Enables manager → care home assignments
- Sets up data filtering by assignments
- Adds RLS policies for security

## 🔍 Verify Deployment

   - Check for missing dependencies

2. **Runtime Errors**
   - Check browser console
   - Verify environment variables are set
   - Check Supabase connection

3. **Database Errors**
   - Ensure migrations are run on production
